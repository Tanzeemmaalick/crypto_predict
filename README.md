# Stock Trend Prediction

![Stock Trend Prediction](stock_trend_prediction.png)

The Stock Trend Prediction project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices. The application allows users to input a stock ticker and visualizes the historical stock price data alongside the predicted price trends.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```
   pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib keras streamlit
   ```

2. Clone the project repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-trend-prediction.git
   cd stock-trend-prediction
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```
   streamlit run stock_trend_prediction.py
   ```

## Features

- Input a stock ticker to predict its price trends.
- Visualize historical stock price data from 2010 to the current date.
- View the predicted price trends generated by the LSTM model.

## Data Source

The application fetches historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API. The data includes the stock's opening, closing, high, low prices, and volume.

## LSTM Model

The LSTM model is trained on the historical stock price data to predict future trends. It uses a sequence of past prices to forecast the next price.

## How to Use

1. Enter the stock ticker of your choice in the text input provided.
2. Click "Run App" to execute the application and generate predictions.
3. The app will display historical stock price data and predicted trends on a line chart.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- Streamlit

## Predictions Disclaimer

Please note that the stock price predictions generated by the LSTM model are purely based on historical data and do not guarantee future accuracy. The predictions should not be considered as financial advice or investment recommendations.
